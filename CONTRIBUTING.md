# How to contribute
## Code of conduct
We want to build this project with the Tezos community together. In order to do so you should be guided by the following rules inspired from [here](https://puppet.com/community/community-guidelines/). In general, you should:

    Be nice:
    Be courteous, respectful, and polite to fellow community members. No offensive comments related to gender, gender identity or expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, religion; no sexual images in public spaces, real or implied violence, intimidation, oppression, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, doxxing, or unwelcome sexual attention will be tolerated. We like nice people way better than mean ones!

    Encourage diversity and participation:
    Make everyone in our community feel welcome, regardless of their background, and do everything possible to encourage participation in our community.

    Focus on constructive criticisms:
    When offering suggestions, whether in online discussions or as comments on a pull request, you should always use welcoming and inclusive language. Be respectful of differing viewpoints and the fact that others may not have the same experiences you do. Offer suggestions for improvement, rather than focusing on mistakes. When others critique your work or ideas, gracefully accept the criticisms and default to assuming good intentions.

    Keep it legal:
    Basically, don’t get us in trouble. Share only content that you own, do not share private or sensitive information, and don’t break the law.

    Stay on topic:
    Keep conversation in a thread on topic, whether that’s a pull request or a Slack conversation or anything else. Make sure that you are posting to the correct channel and remember that nobody likes spam.
